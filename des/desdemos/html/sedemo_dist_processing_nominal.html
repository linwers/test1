%% Distributed Processing Resource Modeling

% Copyright 2008 The MathWorks, Inc.
% $Revision: 1.1.6.2 $ $Date: 2009/11/13 04:15:31 $

%% Overview
% This model describes the architecture resources for processing a series
% of jobs using distributed computed resources. The model, building on the
% ideas in the <matlab:showdemo('sedemo_videoframeprocessing'); Distributed
% Video Processing> explore the resource constraints associated with a
% selected architecture.
%
% The figure below illustrates the job and multiprocessor system.
%
% <<../dist_processing_nominal_small.png>>
%
% You can interpret the system as a way to perform
%
% * Signal processing of audio or video frames
%
% * Processing and routing of communication data packets or frames
%
% * Rendering of animation data
%
% * Routing and completion of service requests
%
% The system generates jobs regularly. Assume that the complexity of a
% particular job forces the system to partition the job, process the
% partitions independently, and later reassemble the results into one block
% of data.


%% Structure
% The model includes these components:
%
% * The Job Generation subsystem, which generates jobs at a fixed rate and
%   assigns each job several pieces of data that represent the processing
%   time constants. In this part of the model, each entity represents a
%   job.
%
% * A front-end processor, which partitions jobs using multiple blocks. The
% elabration of the processor is given below the list. 
%
% * The Prepare Partitioned Task for Aggregation subsystem, which copies
%   the Aggregation_Time attribute's value to the Partitioning_Time
%   attribute. As a result, when the partition reaches the server at the
%   top of the model, the service time reflects aggregation time. This
%   subsystem also changes the value of a flag attribute that indicates
%   that the entity needs to be aggregated, not partitioned.
% 
% * A feedback connection in which the entities representing partitions
%   arrive at the same server (Partitioning & Aggregation Processing) that
%   models the initial delay for newly generated jobs.
%
% * A sink block labeled Processed Jobs that absorbs each partition that
%   departs from the server. A given partition does not need to wait for
%   the other partitions of the same job to complete their processing.
%
%
% The front-end processor mentioned before uses the following blocks to partition jobs. 
% 
% * The block labeled Partitioning & Aggregation Processing is a
%        server that models an initial delay before the first partition is
%        available
%
% * The Generate N Partitioned Tasks subsystem creates a stream of
%        partitions at a given rate. The number of partitions per job is
%        the value of the job's Partition_Count attribute. In this
%        subsystem, the input entities represent jobs and the output
%        entities represent partitions.
%     
% * The block labeled Task Queue stores the partitions that are
%        waiting for processing.
%
% * The block labeled Task Processing Delay processes the partitions.

%% Experimenting with the Model
% To explore the resource constraints associated with the architecture in
% this model, try the following:
%
% 1) Run the simulation with default settings. From the plots labeled
%    Partitions Waiting For Aggregation and Jobs Waiting In Queue, you can
%    see that both jobs and partitions accumulate in the queues while the
%    processors are always busy.
sim(modelname);

%%
%
% 2) To attempt to resolve the congestion, increase the number of
%    processors that represent overhead in the partitioning and aggregation
%    process. To do this, open the dialog box of the block labeled
%    Partitioning & Aggregation Processing and change the Number of servers
%    parameter from 1 to 16.

set_param([modelname '/Partitioning & Aggregation Processing'],'NumberOfServers','16')

%%
% 3) Run the simulation again. The plots indicate that the queues now
%    remain empty.

sim(modelname);

%%
% 4) Run the simulation for 2 seconds. The plots indicate that adding more
%    processors merely delays the congestion instead of resolving it.

set_param(modelname,'StopTime','2')
sim(modelname);

%%
% 5) Undo step 2 by setting the Number of servers parameter in the block
%    labeled Partitioning & Aggregation Processing to 1.

set_param([modelname '/Partitioning & Aggregation Processing'],'NumberOfServers','1')

%%
% 6) Increase the number of processors that represent the time to process
%    each partition. To do this, open the dialog box of the block labeled
%    Task Processing Delay and change the Number of servers parameter from
%    128 to 256.

set_param([modelname '/Task Processing Delay'],'NumberOfServers','256')

%%
% 7) Run the simulation again. The plots indicate that the queues remain
%    empty for a long time. The congestion has been resolved.

sim(modelname);

%%
% *Experimenting Further*
%
% To expand on the architecture, you can refine the model in any of these
% ways:
%
% * Include delays due to data access over a network
%
% * Introduce probabilistic values for various processing times to assess
%   the robustness of the solution
%
% * Include details of the processors' algorithms or hardware architecture
