%% G/G/1 Queuing System and Little's Law

% Copyright 2008-2009 The MathWorks, Inc.
% $Revision: 1.1.6.2 $ $Date: 2009/10/16 04:48:17 $

%% Overview
% This model contains a single-queue single-server system in which the
% interarrival time and the service time are uniformly distributed with
% fixed means of 1.1 and 1, respectively. The queue has an infinite storage
% capacity. In the notation, the G stands for a general distribution with a
% known mean and variance; G/G/1 means that the system's interarrival and
% service times are governed by such a general distribution, and that the
% system has one server. You can change the variances of the uniform
% distributions. You can use this model to examine Little's law.

%% Structure of the Model
% The model includes the components listed below:
%
% * *Time Based Entity Generator block:* Source of entities (also known as
% “customers” in queuing theory).
%
% * *Uniform Distribution for Interarrival Time subsystem:* Creates a
% signal representing the interarrival times for the generated entities.
% After you set the distribution's variance using the Arrival Process
% Variance block, the subsystem computes a uniform random variate with the
% chosen variance and mean 1.1. To see the computation details, select the
% Uniform Distribution for Interarrival Time subsystem, choose Edit > Look
% Under Mask and double-click the block labeled Uniform Distribution.
%
% * *FIFO Queue block:* It stores entities that have yet to be served.
%
% * *Single Server block:* Models a server whose service time has a uniform
% distribution.
%
% * *Attribute Function block labeled Generate Service Time with Uniform
%    Distribution:* Assigns a service time to each attribute. After you set
%    the distribution's variance using the Service Process Variance block,
%    this block computes a uniform random variate with the chosen variance
%    and mean 1.

%% Results and Displays
% The model includes these visual ways to understand its performance:
%
% *  Display blocks that show the queue workload, average waiting time
%    in the queue, average service time, and server utilization.
%
% *  A scope showing the number of entities (customers) in the queue at
%    any given time
%
% *  A scope comparing empirical and theoretical ratios. See the
%    discussion of Little's law below.

set_param([modelname '/Arrival Rate: Theoretical  vs. Simulation Results'],'Open', 'on' );
sim(modelname);

%% Little's Law
% You can use this model to verify Little's law, which states the linear
% relationship between average queue length and average waiting time in the
% queue. In particular, the expected relationship is as follows:
% 
% Average queue length = (Mean arrival rate)(Average waiting time in queue)
% 
% The FIFO Queue block computes the current queue length and average
% waiting time in the queue. The subsystem called Little's Law Evaluation
% computes the ratio of average queue length (derived from the
% instantaneous queue length via integration) to average waiting time, as
% well as the ratio of mean service time to mean arrival time. The two
% ratios appear on the plot labeled Arrival Rate: Theoretical vs.
% Simulation Results.
% 
% Another way to interpret the equation above is that, given a normalized
% mean service time of 1, you can use the average waiting time and average
% queue length to derive the system's arrival rate.
%
%% Little's Law Applied to the Server
% You can also use this model to verify the linear relationship that
% Little's law predicts between the server utilization and the average
% service time. The Single Server block computes the server utilization and
% average waiting time in the server. Because each entity can depart from
% the server immediately upon completing service, waiting time is
% equivalent to service time for the server in this model.


%% Experimenting with the Model
% Move the Arrival Process Variance slider or the Service Process Variance
% slider during the simulation and observe how the queue content changes.
% When traffic intensity is high, the average waiting time in the queue is
% approximately linear in the variances of the interarrival time and
% service time. The larger the variances are, the longer an entity has to
% wait, and the more entities are waiting in the system.
