%% Go-Back-N Automatic Repeat Request

% Copyright 2008 The MathWorks, Inc.
% $Revision: 1.1.6.3 $ $Date: 2009/11/13 04:15:25 $

%% Overview
% This model simulates a go-back-N automatic repeat request (ARQ) system.
% Packets are created, transmitted over a channel, and affected by errors
% with a probability determined by the Forward Channel. For each data frame
% it receives, the receiver uses the return channel to send an
% acknowledgement (ACK) or nonacknowledgement (NAK) message back to the
% transmitter, based on a cyclic redundancy code (CRC) check. Upon
% receiving a NAK message, the transmitter retransmits all frames that have
% not yet been acknowledged with an ACK. By modeling the transmission and
% flow of data frames, this model lets you visualize the system's behavior
% and analyze its performance under different conditions.
%
% This model's transmitter and receiver subsystems also illustrate how to
% use SimEvents blocks and Stateflow® blocks together.

%% Structure of the Model
% *Frame Creation*
%
% This subsystem generates data frames with an exponential intergeneration
% time. Each frame has a unique sequence number that identifies it. (This
% demo uses the term “frame” in an abstract sense that is unrelated to
% frame-based signals in Simulink® software.)
%
% *Transmitter*
%
% The transmitter transmits frames and also retransmits corrupted frames
% based on ACK and NAK messages from the receiver. An entity whose ack
% attribute is 1 corresponds to an ACK message, while 0 corresponds to a
% NAK message.
%
% Enhances the ability to model clock drift between the transmitter and
% receiver. This demo adds a sinusoidally varying error in symbol timing to
% the original demo's constant error.
% 
% The transmitter uses a Stateflow chart to control the transmission and
% retransmission of frames. The transmitter state can have one of these
% values: 
%
% * _Transmitting_ — Placing a new data frame on the link
%
% * _Retransmitting_ — Retransmitting data frames across the link
%
% * _WaitingToRetransmit_ — Waiting for the link to become available in order
%   to start retransmission of rejected frames
%
% * _Idle_ — Not transmitting because no new data is available or the maximum
%   number of outstanding frames has been reached
%
% *Forward Channel and Reverse Channel*
%
% The forward and reverse channels represent the propagation delay, assumed
% to be longer than the delay associated with transmission. That is, the
% transmitter finishes sending the complete frame before the receiver
% begins receiving it. Packets are potentially corrupted, but not dropped,
% during transmission. The reverse channel is assumed to be error-free.
%
% *Addition of errors*
%
% This subsystem corrupts packets with a given probability. The model
% assumes that the receiver can detect an error via a CRC check but cannot
% correct the error.
%
% *Receiver*
%
% The receiver sends an ACK or NAK message back to the transmitter for each
% frame and either accepts or rejects the frame according to the CRC check.
% After rejecting a frame, the receiver continues to reject frames until
% the originally rejected frame is correctly received. A Stateflow chart
% controls the state of the receiver as either accepting or rejecting data
% frames.
