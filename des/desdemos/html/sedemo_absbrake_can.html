%% Overview
% 
% This model (Fig 1) extends the 
% <matlab:showdemo('sedemo_absbrake_delay')
% Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) Model with Queuing Delay> demo by making
% the timing uncertainty representative of real-world timing conditions.
%
% Refer to the
% <matlab:showdemo('sedemo_absbrake_overview_m')
% Design Workflow for an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS)> demo to see where
% this model fits into the model-based design workflow.
%
% In this model, the delay is primarily a function of traffic on a network
% that conveys data from the ABS controller and other components. This 
% demo includes a model of a Control Area Network Bus (CANbus) ISO(R) 
% Standard 11898. To see the modeling of the network, refer to Fig 2.

modelname = 'sedemo_absbrake_can';

%

%% Structure and Behavior of the Network
% 
% The CANbus subsystem (Fig 2) includes a shared channel
% (labeled CAN BUS Arbitration) and 
% multiple nodes that connect to it via TX and RX ports. The bus uses the 
% priority values of simultaneously arriving messages to determine which 
% message to convey.
% 
% The middle node generates messages that carry data from the bang-bang 
% controller at the top level of the model. The CAN Node 2 subsystem 
% governs this node's access to the shared channel. The destination of 
% these messages is the top node.
% 
% The top node reads data stored in attributes of the messages it receives, 
% and sends the data to the Hydraulic Lag block in the anti-lock braking 
% system.
% 
% The top node also generates messages whose destination is the middle 
% node. The Message Delivery Delay plot shows you how long each of these 
% messages takes to arrive at their destination.
% 
% The bottom node generates messages that represent traffic from other 
% users of the shared channel. The traffic becomes markedly heavier shortly 
% after T=6.

open_system([modelname, '/CANbus'], 'force');

%

%% Transmission & Reception in CAN Node Subsystems
% 
% *Transmission Model*
%
% In the top portion of each CAN Node subsystem (Fig 3), a buffer holds 
% messages waiting for transmission. When the transmission of the previous 
% message is complete, the Send to Channel block forwards one copy of the 
% message to the transmitter and keeps another copy until a signal called 
% Ack reports the success or failure of the transmission. If the 
% transmission fails, the copy of the message returns to the transmission 
% buffer for another attempt.

open_system([modelname, '/CANbus/CAN Node 1'], 'force');

%%
% _Fig 3: Transmission & Reception_
%

%% 
% *Reception Model*
% 
% In the bottom portion of each CAN Node subsystem (shown in Fig 3), the Error 
% Detection block checks the source and destination of the received 
% message. A message from this node serves to confirm success of the 
% transmission. A message from another node whose destination is this node 
% advances to one of several mailboxes that represent different clients.
%

%% CAN BUS Arbitration Subsystem
% 
% The CAN BUS Arbitration subsystem (Fig 4) implements a CSMA/AMP (Carrier Sense Multiple 
% Access with Arbitration by Message Priority) protocol. When the bus 
% becomes free, all nodes that have pending messages send them to the bus. 
% If multiple messages arrive at the same time, the Arbitration on Message 
% Priority block uses their priority values to discard all but the highest 
% priority message. This block also delays the remaining message by the 
% time required to send the message over the bus. After this time elapses, 
% the bus conveys a copy of the delayed message to each node.

open_system([modelname, '/CANbus/CAN BUS Arbitration'], 'force');

%

%% Results and Displays
% 
% Scopes show these simulation results (Fig 5):
% 
% * Delay in the delivery of messages from one node to another
% * Utilization of the network
% * Normalized relative slip of the wheel
% * Speed of the vehicle and wheel

sim(modelname);

%%
% _Fig 5: Simulation results_
% 
% You can see that the utilization increases steeply to reflect the 
% heavier background traffic after T=6. The traffic also causes the delay 
% to increase by approximately one order of magnitude after T=6.
%

%% Experimenting with the Model
% 
% Vary the arrival rate of background traffic on the network by changing 
% the value of the Average Arrival Rate block at the top level of the 
% model. Then observe changes in the plots. In general, increasing the 
% arrival rate causes the network utilization and message delivery delay to 
% increase and causes the performance of the anti-lock braking system to 
% degrade. You might observe changes in performance via differences in the 
% time it takes for the car to stop, and how much the car skids. When the 
% normalized relative slip is 1 and the wheel speed is 0, the car is 
% skidding.
