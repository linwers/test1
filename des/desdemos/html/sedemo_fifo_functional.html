%% Introduction
% This demo shows how to build an asynchronous first in, first out 
% (FIFO) buffer and use it to model data transfer between two
% processors.  The demo shows you to explore the effect of buffer space
% limitations on the data transfer.  The demo also shows how 
% to use the buffer to regulate data passing between processors 
% operating at different clock speeds.  This demo models the 
% functional behavior at an abstract level which is useful in
% sizing the buffer before implementing in hardware. 
% 
% The modeling of the buffer with more architectural
% details is shown in 
% <matlab:simeventsdemohelp('sedemo_fifo_architectural'); FIFO Buffer: Architectural Model>.

%% Overview of FIFO Buffer Model
% A FIFO buffer is a hardware component that stores data as a part of 
% data exchange between processors.  The FIFO Queue block 
% enables simulation of such buffers in software.  Each
% processor is driven by a clock.  Because each clock synchronizes the
% processor hardware, the clock appears synchronous to that processor.  
% However, the clocks of two or more processors are typically not 
% synchronous with each other. 
%
% This model consists of two processor subsystems, 
% Processor A and Processor B, with their corresponding clocks.  
% The processor subsystems have entity connections to the FIFO Queue
% block. These entity connections and the entities that move along them 
% implicitly enforce blocking between blocks. 
% This allows the FIFO Queue block to buffer and regulate the 
% movement of data between Processor A and Processor B.

%% Detailed Description of Processors
% The Processor A subsystem contains an Event-Based Entity Generator
% block clocked by the System A Clock.  As the entity is generated, it 
% fires the Processor A State subsystem.  The subsystem increments 
% state A and updates the attribute of the passing entity.  
% The generated entity then advances to the FIFO Queue block.  

open_system([modelname '/Processor A Subsystem']);

%%
% The FIFO Queue block is connected to the Processor B subsystem.  Inside this
% subsystem, the Release Gate block is clocked by the System B Clock.  When 
% the Release Gate block is opens, the entity, if available, advances from the 
% FIFO Queue block and fires the Processor B State subsystem,
% which updates state B with the attribute value from the entity. 

open_system([modelname '/Processor B Subsystem']);

%%
% The clock generation technique is documented in 
% <sedemo_async_clocks.html Asynchronous Clock Domains>.

close_system([modelname '/Processor A Subsystem']);
close_system([modelname '/Processor B Subsystem']);

%% Behavior of the FIFO Buffer Model Capacity Estimation for Drifting Clocks
% Setting the *Capacity* parameter for the FIFO Queue block 
% to 4 and the *Allow Blocking* parameter for the Event-Based 
% Entity Generator in the Processor A subsystem to 'off' disallows 
% blocking for Processor A and demonstrates whether the 
% buffer size of 4 is sufficient to allow the processors
% to communicate without Processor A having to pause to 
% permit Processor B to catch up.  A buffer capacity of 4 results in 
% a run-time error because the FIFO Queue block is too small.  This error
% causes the simulation to terminate early which results in 
% the incomplete plots.

set_param([modelname '/Processor A Subsystem/Event-Based Entity Generator'], ...
					 'AllowBlocking', 'off');
sedemo_helper([modelname '/Instrumentation/Value of ''A'''],'CloseFig');
sedemo_helper([modelname '/Instrumentation/Value of ''B'''],'CloseFig');
set_param([modelname '/FIFO Queue'], 'Capacity', '4');
try
	sim(modelname);
catch E
	E.message
end

%%
% However, setting the *Allow Blocking* parameter for the Event-Based Entity Generator
% in the Processor A subsystem to 'on' permits blocking for the entity generator. 
% This allows processor A to respond to blocking by delaying the generation
% of entities until space is available in the FIFO Queue block.  Running
% the models shows how this setting enables the simulation to continue 
% with delayed delivery of values to Processor B.  

set_param([modelname '/Processor A Subsystem/Event-Based Entity Generator'], ...
					 'AllowBlocking', 'on');
sim(modelname);

%%
% With these settings, Processor A increments its state only if an entity 
% can advance to the FIFO Queue block. The delay from Processor A to 
% Processor B varies with the difference between the instantaneous
% frequency of the clocks used for each processor.   This delay is 
% apparent in the plot of 'A' - 'B'.
%
% Setting the capacity of the FIFO Queue block back to 8 and disallowing
% blocking for the Entity Generator for Processor A by returning the 
% *Allow Blocking* parameter for the Event-Based Entity Generator in the 
% Processor A Subsystem to 'off' allows the
% simulation to run to completion.  The maximum value in 
% the Number in Buffer plot, 5, is the minimum buffer size required
% to support communications between the processors. 

set_param([modelname '/Processor A Subsystem/Event-Based Entity Generator'], ...
					 'AllowBlocking', 'off');
set_param([modelname '/FIFO Queue'], 'Capacity', '8');
sim(modelname);


%% Behavior of the FIFO Buffer Model for Different Clock Speeds
% Changing the settings so the clock for Processor A runs faster than
% the clock for Processor B and so there is no variation in clock rate
% demonstrates that the FIFO Queue's blocking via the entity paths is
% regulating the rate at which Processor A sends updates to Processor B.
% The clock speed for Processor A is set to 100 by changing the 
% Bias parameter for the Interval for Clock A block to 0.01 while the 
% drift in the clock rate is eliminated by setting the Amplitude
% parameter to 0.  The clock speed and drifting of Processor B is
% adjusted similarly. 

set_param([modelname '/Processor A Subsystem/Event-Based Entity Generator'], ...
					 'AllowBlocking', 'on');
set_param([modelname '/Interval For Clock A'], 'Bias', '0.01');
set_param([modelname '/Interval For Clock A'], 'Amplitude', '0');
set_param([modelname '/Interval For Clock B'], 'Bias', '0.015');
set_param([modelname '/Interval For Clock B'], 'Amplitude', '0');
sim(modelname);

%%
% The plots show that the number of entities in the FIFO Queue block
% rises quickly to the capacity of the buffer, 8, and then remains at 
% that level until the end of the simulation.  This indicates that 
% Processor A has filled the FIFO Queue block.  When the FIFO Queue block
% reaches capacity, Processor A cannot send a new entity to the
% FIFO Queue block until Processor B accepts an entity from the FIFO Queue 
% block.  
%
% Changing the settings so the clock for Processor A is runs slower than
% the clock for Processor B demonstrates the FIFO Queue block's ability to 
% fulfill requests from Processor B by either requesting an entity from 
% the FIFO Queue block and, if necessary, waiting until an entity is  
% available from Processor A. 

set_param([modelname '/Interval For Clock A'], 'Bias', '0.01');
set_param([modelname '/Interval For Clock B'], 'Bias', '0.007');
sim(modelname);

%%
% The plots show that the number of entities in the FIFO Queue block
% alternates between 1 and 0 showing that each entity waits in the
% FIFO Queue block for a short period before advancing to Processor B.
