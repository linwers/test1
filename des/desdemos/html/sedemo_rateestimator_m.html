%% Building an Arrival Rate Estimator

% Copyright 2005-2008 The MathWorks, Inc.
% $Revision: 1.1.6.1 $ $Date: 2008/06/13 15:14:57 $

%% Overview of Demo
% This demo illustrates the process of designing and troubleshooting a
% performance measurement in a discrete-event simulation. The measurement
% is an estimate of the entity arrival rate at a point in the entity path.
% However, other model-building situations can apply the demo's general
% ideas related to building a design incrementally and comparing simulation
% behavior with expectations.

%% Task: Estimate Entity Rate at a Point
% The design task is to estimate the rate or throughput of parts, messages,
% jobs, or other items that entities represent in your application. The
% model below can serve as a test bed for a rate estimator. Entities arrive
% at the Arrival Rate Estimator subsystem at a piecewise constant rate of
% 1/4 or 0 over different time intervals during the simulation.
open_system sedemo_rateestimator_initialdesign;

%% Part 1: Initial Design of Rate Estimator Subsystem
% Inside the Arrival Rate Estimator subsystem is a function-call subsystem
% that performs a rate estimation computation and blocks that dictate when
% to perform the computation. The computation involves the time interval
% between successive entities, so performing the computation upon each
% entity arrival makes sense.
open_system('sedemo_rateestimator_initialdesign/Arrival Rate Estimator','force');

%% Results of Initial Design
% The plot of the switching criterion shows that entities arrive at the
% rate estimator during the time intervals (0,200), (400,600), and
% (800,1000). During these intervals, the entity arrival rate is 1/4, or,
% 0.25.
%
% The rate plot shows that during these time intervals, the rate
% estimator produces values near 0.25 after an initial transient that
% corresponds to start of the simulation or sudden changes in the rate.
sim sedemo_rateestimator_initialdesign;
close_system('sedemo_rateestimator_initialdesign/Arrival Rate Estimator');

%% Problem with Results of Initial Design
% The rate estimation is less successful during the time intervals
% (200,400), (600,800), and (1000,1200), when no entities
% arrive at the rate estimator. Across each of these time intervals, the
% plot shows a line segment from a value near 0.25 to a value near 0. A
% faster decay to 0 would more accurately represent the actual entity rate.
% Also, you might expect more symmetry between the rate=1/4 time intervals
% and the rate=0 time intervals.
%
% The reason for the problem is that the Arrival Rate Estimator subsystem
% performs a computation upon each entity arrival, but does not update the
% computation to reflect the absence of entities.

%% Part 2: Investigation via Periodic Estimation
% One way to investigate the problem is to try the same computation with
% simpler timing characteristics. In particular, perform the computation
% periodically to ensure that the computation occurs even when no entities
% arrive. Connect the function-call subsystem to a time-based Function-Call
% Generator block instead of the event-based block labeled Perform
% Computation Upon Arrival.
sedemo_rateestimator_timebasedfcn;

%% Results of Periodic Estimation
% The rate plot is now more symmetric and shows a faster decay to 0 during
% the idle intervals, that is, time intervals when no entities arrive. While
% periodic computations are not desirable in the final design, this interim
% design increases confidence in the underlying rate estimation computation
% and suggests that performing the computation during idle intervals might
% address the problem with the results of Part 1.
sim sedemo_rateestimator_initialdesign;

%% Part 3: Improved Event-Based Estimation
% The next design modifies the original model by incorporating periodic
% estimates during idle intervals. In particular, the model performs the
% rate estimation computation when either:
%
% * An entity has arrived.
% * A predetermined amount of time has elapsed since the last entity
% arrival.
%
% In the images below, the top level is unchanged but the Arrival Rate
% Estimator subsystem includes a subsystem labeled Control Computation
% During Idle Intervals.
open_system sedemo_rateestimator_withidlecomp;
open_system('sedemo_rateestimator_withidlecomp/Arrival Rate Estimator','force');

%% Computations During Idle Intervals
% The subsystem that controls computations during idle intervals uses
% timeouts to indicate that the predetermined amount of time has elapsed
% since the last entity arrival in the top-level system.
%
% * When a timeout occurs, a function call causes the Arrival Rate
% Estimator subsystem to perform the rate estimation computation.
% * When an entity arrives in the top-level system, the timeout clock
% resets.
%
% The timeouts apply to a single entity that travels in loops around this
% subsystem and that measures idle time.
open_system(['sedemo_rateestimator_withidlecomp/Arrival Rate Estimator/' ...
   'Control Computations During Idle Intervals']); 

%% Refined Simulation Results
% The simulation results address the problems from Part 1 while retaining
% event-based timing of the rate estimation computation during nonidle
% intervals.
sim sedemo_rateestimator_withidlecomp;

%% Conclusions
% * The initial design incorporated some aspects of the desired solution:
% in this case, a computational subsystem and an event-based calling
% strategy.
% * Running the simulation on a relatively simple test case facilitated
% comparison of simulation results with expectations. The comparison showed
% that the initial design did not account for long idle intervals.
% * Simplifying one aspect of the design, in this case the timing for
% calling the computational subsystem, helped build understanding and
% support a refinement that added complexity to the next design.
