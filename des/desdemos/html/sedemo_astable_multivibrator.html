%% Astable Multivibrator Circuit

%% Overview
% This model demonstrates how to model a hybrid system containing
% event-driven and time-driven behavior.
%
% The system in this model is the simple astable multivibrator circuit
% shown below. An astable multivibrator is a two-stage switching circuit
% that generates a square wave with no external triggering pulse. The
% circuit switches between its two stable states, remaining in each state
% for a duration that depends on the discharging of the capacitive circuit.
%
% <<astable_multivibrator_ckt.jpg>>
%
% To focus on the integration of the time-driven and event-driven aspects,
% the model makes these simplifying assumptions:
%
% * Transistors change their on/off states instantaneously.
%
% * The turn-on voltage for transistors is 0.6 V.

%% Circuit Operation
% * When supply voltage, Vcc, is applied, one transistor conducts more than
%   the other due to imbalance in resistance and capacitance values.
%
% * Suppose that Q1 is on and Q2 is off. The voltage at the output of Q1 is
%   approximately Vcesat, which is zero.
%
% * Immediately after Q1 turns on, C1 charges with the time constant R1C1
%   toward the supply voltage through R1. That is, Vbe of Q2 increases
%   asymptotically towards VCC.
%
% * When Vbe of Q2 crosses the turn-on voltage, Q2 turns on and voltage at
%   the output of Q2 drops to approximately zero.
%
% * Immediately after Q2 turns on, Vbe of Q1 falls due to capacitive
%   coupling between the collector of Q2 and the base of Q1. As a result,
%   Q1 turns off.
%
% * Immediately after Q2 turns on, C2 charges with the time constant R2C2
%   toward the supply voltage through R2. That is, Vbe of Q1 increases
%   asymptotically towards VCC.
%
% * When Vbe of Q1 crosses the turn-on voltage, Q1 turns on again and the
%   process repeats.


%% Structure of the Model
%
% The model has a symmetric arrangement of blocks representing the two
% branches in the circuit. Each branch in the block diagram has a
% feedback connection to the other branch. Each branch includes these
% components:
%
% * Enabled subsystem — Models the variation in the base voltage when a
%   transistor switches its on/off state. In this subsystem, a Transfer Fcn
%   block models the charging and discharging of the RC circuit.
%
% * Switching Logic subsystem — Switches based on the potential barrier. In
%   this subsystem, the Saturation block enables the detection of level
%   crossings, while the Embedded MATLAB Function block contains the logic.
%
% * Signal Latch block — Allows the transistor Vce or the input to the RC
%   circuit to have two values at one time. The sequence of these values is
%   controlled by the block's event-based operation, which enables the
%   feedback to occur without delay.
