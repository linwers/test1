%% Bit Timing Recovery Using Fixed-Rate Resampling and SimEvents

% Copyright 2008 The MathWorks, Inc.

%% Overview
% This model, which is based on the Timing Recovery Using Fixed-Rate
% Resampling demo in the Communications Blocksetâ„¢ product, illustrates how
% to model the time-varying drifting of clocks at a transmitter and
% receiver in a communication system. Furthermore, the technique in this
% model exploits asynchronous behavior, which is more efficient during the
% simulation than the original demo's technique of tracking zero crossings
% of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) in continuous time.
%
% To learn about the underlying communication system, ways to explore the
% demo, and what the plots mean, see the description of the
% <matlab:showdemo('commtimrecresample'); original Timing Recovery Using
% Fixed-Rate Resampling>  demo. The rest of this section describes how this
% demo differs from the original and how this demo implements time-varying
% drifting of clocks.

%% Comparison with Original Demo
% Unlike the original demo, this demo
%
% * Uses a discrete-event function-call generator instead of a
%   continuous-time VCO within the QPSK Transmitter subsystem.
%
% * Omits a carrier offset, instead focusing more on the timing recovery
%   process.  
% You can see the difference in the QPSK Transmitter subsystem's
%   Carrier Offset and Conversion to Continuous Time subsystem and also in the absence of the
%   Enable carrier recovery option in the block labeled Adjust Demo
%   Settings.
%
% * Enhances the ability to model clock drift between the transmitter and
%   receiver. This demo adds a sinusoidally varying error in symbol timing
%   to the original demo's constant error.
% 
% The sinusoidal error causes an error in symbol timing that varies
% smoothly and assumes positive and negative values. The drift in the
% transmitter's symbol clock causes the timing recovery component in the
% receiver to continually change the rate at which it drifts in response.
% 
% If you run the original demo with a carrier offset of 0 and run this demo
% with a sinusoidal error of 0, you get equivalent results.

%% Calling a Subsystem at Arbitrary Times
% The figure below, which shows part of the QPSK Transmitter subsystem's
% DES Voltage Controlled Sample Rate subsystem, illustrates how this demo
% calls a function-call subsystem at arbitrary times during the simulation.
% The arbitrary times do not need to be multiples of a fundamental sample
% time.
%
% <<timrecresample_fcncalls.png>>
%
% During the simulation, blocks in the figure behave as follows:
%
% 1. At time T0=0, the Function-Call Generator block generates a function
%    call.
%
% 2. The function call at time T0 causes the Signal-Based Event to
%    Function-Call Event block to read the current value, t0, of the t
%    input signal. The block then schedules an event for time T1=T0+t0.
%
%      In this model, the t signal is the reciprocal of the sum of the
%      reference frequency, constant frequency error, and sinusoidal
%      frequency error.
% 
% 3. When the scheduled event is processed at time Ti (i=1,2,3,...), the
%    Signal-Based Event to Function-Call Event block issues two function
%    calls:
%
%      a. The function call at the f1 output port connects to a Mux block,
%         which in turn connects to the same Signal-Based Event to
%         Function-Call Event block. In other words, the Signal-Based Event
%         to Function-Call Event calls itself. (The purpose of this Mux
%         block is to create a union of function calls from more than one
%         source.) 
%
%         This function call causes the block to read the current value,
%         ti, of the t input signal. The block then schedules an event for
%         time Ti+1=Ti+ti.
%
%      b. The function call at the f2 output port calls the function-call
%         subsystem that connects to the outport. The function-call
%         subsystem does not appear because it is in the upper level of the
%         block diagram. 
%   
%      
%
% 4. The process in step 3 repeats throughout the simulation. In effect,
%    the Signal-Based Event to Function-Call Event block uses the t input
%    signal as an intergeneration time for generating function calls, uses
%    the f1 output port to iterate, and uses the f2 output port to call the
%    function-call subsystem at the desired times.
