%% Video Streaming Over Bandwidth-Limited Communication Channel

% Copyright 2008 The MathWorks, Inc.
% $Revision: 1.1.6.2 $ $Date: 2009/11/13 04:15:49 $

%% Overview
% This model illustrates a communication system that sends frames of video
% data over a channel. By dropping frames that wait too long to reach the
% end user, the model also illustrates how to use timeouts to implement
% point-to-point timing constraints.

%% Structure of the Model
% The model includes the sections listed below.
%
% * Video source — Attaches frames of video data to entities at a constant
%   rate using matrix-valued attributes of the entities. The source also
%   uses the Schedule Timeout block to establish each frame's time-to-live
%   (TTL) value, which is the duration until the channel drops that frame
%   if it has not yet reached the end user.
%
% * Bandwidth-limited communication channel — Buffers the incoming frames
%   and delays them for a period of time. If the TTL for a given frame
%   elapses before it has reached the end user, then the channel discards
%   the frame. Removing outdated video data from the system results in an
%   improved quality of service because the channel focuses on newer data
%   that is more relevant to the end user.
%
% * Video end-user — Buffers the received frames and forwards them to a
%   viewer block at a constant rate.

modelname = 'sedemo_video_streaming';
open_system(modelname);

%% Watching the Video Viewer
%
% When you run the simulation, the Video Viewer block opens to display
%   the received video. You can observe the following behavior:
%
% * The viewer is initially blank and does not start to display the video
%   until T=10. The reason is that the block labeled Flow Control changes its output
%     value from 0 to 1 at T=10, which enables the periodic release of frames
%     to the viewer.
%
% * The video repeats a few times, but has a discontinuity near T=37. 
%     Also, between approximately T=31 and T=36, the plot of timed-out
%     entities rises steeply. Frames time out when they experience a delay
%     in the channel equal to their TTL value. Around T=31, accumulated
%     delays cause many consecutive frames to time out, leaving a gap in
%     the video data. Even when the channel resumes sending frames to the
%     end user, you notice the gap when you watch the video in the viewer.

%% Results and Displays
%
% Scopes in the model plot the following quantities to help you understand
% its performance:
%
% * The size of the input buffer shows how many frames are waiting in the
%   channel. Frames accumulate in the input buffer until they either
%   progress through the channel or time out.
%
% * The size of the reception buffer shows how many frames are waiting in
%   the receiver. Before T=10, frames accumulate in the reception buffer
%   because the block labeled Flow Control keeps the path closed between
%   the receiver's buffer and the video viewer.
%
% * The status of underflow events in the receiver has a value of 1
%   whenever the Release Gate block permits a frame to advance from the
%   reception buffer to the video viewer, but no frame is present. For more
%   about this, see Experimenting with the Model below.
%
% * The communication delay per frame shows how long the channel delays
%   each frame that has advanced beyond the input buffer. In this model,
%   the delay is periodic.
%
% * The number of timed-out entities shows how many frames have timed out
%   in the channel. The end user does not receive these frames and can
%   observe a gap in the video if many consecutive frames time out.




%% Experimenting with the Model
% To vary the simulation behavior, decrease the initial delay in the end
% user's viewing by changing the Step time parameter from 10 to 3 in the
% block labeled Flow Control. As a result, the simulation has some
% instances at which the gate opens to let a frame advance, but the
% reception buffer is empty. You can see values of 0 in the plot of the
% reception buffer's size and values of 1 in the plot of underflow events.
%
% Note: To run this simulation, you must have a license for the Video and
% Image Processing Blockset™ product.
