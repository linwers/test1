%% Ethernet Local Area Network
%Copyright 2005-2008 The MathWorks, Inc.

%% Overview
% 
% This model simulates an Ethernet LAN with three computers and a shared channel 
% operated at 10 Mbps. The MAC Controller block implements the CSMA/CD 
% (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) protocol. 

%% Structure of the Model
% The top level of the model includes three computers, each consisting of the 
% following:
% 
% * An Application block that models the consumer of data.
% * A MAC (medium access control) controller that governs the computer's use of the 
%  shared channel.
% * A T-junction that connects the computer to the network.
% 
% You can specify the packet generation rate and packet size range at the Application 
% blocks, the transmission buffer size at the MAC Controller blocks, and the length 
% of the cable at the Cable blocks. 
% The terminator, T-junction, and cable blocks at the bottom of the model represent 
% physical components of the network.

model_name = 'sedemo_ethernet';
open_system(model_name);
%%  Implementing the CSMA/CD Protocol
% 
% Standard Ethernet networks use a CSMA/CD protocol to manage use of the shared 
% channel. Each computer's MAC controller physically monitors the traffic on the 
% channel and initiates a transmission only when the controller detects no other 
% traffic on the channel. If transmissions from two computers compete for use of the 
% channel, then a collision occurs. Packets that collide with other packets can make 
% a fixed number of additional attempts after a waiting period elapses, using the 
% binary exponential backoff algorithm.
% 
% In this model, the CSMA/CD protocol is implemented in the MAC Controller
% subsystems.
open_system('sedemo_ethernet/MAC Controller (B)', 'force');

% The Transmission Buffer block holds packets waiting for transmission. 
% When the carrier-sensing component modeled in CSMA/CD subsystem indicates that the channel is ready, the Medium Access Control block that acts as a gate opens 
% and the packet advances to the subsystem's TX output port. This output port
% permits the packet to advance to the T-junction.
% In the course of advancing past the Medium Access Control block to the TX output port, 
% the packet also passes through a Replicate block that makes a copy of the packet. D
% The CSMA/CD subsystem uses this copy to observe the channel's state and to implement CSMA/CD.
% In particular, the subsystem tracks the packets that use the channel, determines 
% when the channel is not busy, and determines when the channel experiences a 
% collision between two packets. For packets that experience a collision, 
% the Backoff Controller subsystem determines whether and when a packet reattempts 
% transmission.

%% Results and Displays
% This model includes various visualization that capture the performance of
% this Ethernet bus:
%
% * Display blocks that show the number of packets that each computer observes as 
%   successful or unsuccessful communications. Propagation delay modeled in the 
%   Cable blocks can cause different computers to observe slightly different results.
% * The Throughput plot shows the ransmission throughput at one of the
% computers.
% * The Channel Utilization plot shows the proportion of time that the
% channel is in use.
