%% Distributed Processing for Multi-Class Jobs
% Copyright 2005-2008 The MathWorks, Inc.
%% Overview
% This model demonstrates how to model a central resource that manages distributed processing according to an explicit formula. The terminology in the model
% describes a distribution center that manages a series of processes that each job undergoes, where each job carries information about the series of processes
% that it must undergo. One of the applications where it could be useful is a central dispatcher that routes each call from one call processing station to another.

%%
model_name = 'sedemo_star_routing';
open_system(model_name);
%%  Multiple-Class Job Generation Subsystem
% This subsystem produces jobs that possess these attributes:
%
% *  |JobClass| - A value of 1, 2, or 3, which determines the value of
% |ServiceProcess| and |ServiceTime|
% 
% *  |JobID| - An integer between 1 and 15. This acts as an identifier for each
% job. This can be used to track a job as it moves through the different
% service stations.
% 
% *  |LastServiceLocation| - 0 initially, to be modified during the simulation as the job visits different service stations
% 
% *  |JobServiceStatus| - A vector of 0s initially, to be modified during the simulation as the job completes different processes
% 
% *  |ServiceProcess| - A vector that lists the processes that the job undergoes
% 
% *  |ServiceTime| - A vector that lists the duration of each process that
% appears in |ServiceProcess|
% 
% *  |CurrentStep| - 1 initially, to be modified during the simulation as
% the job progresses through its series of processes

open_system([model_name,'/Multiple-Class Job Generation']);

%% Distribution Center Subsystem
% This subsystem uses the vector elements of each job's  |ServiceProcess| attribute to route the entity to the correct service station. The
% distribution center also updates information that the job carries about its current state.
% 
% During the simulation, each job follows a trajectory from the distribution center to a service station, back to the distribution center, to a (possibly
% different) service station, and so on. The particular trajectory depends on the  |ServiceProcess| attribute value.

%% Service Station Subsystems
% Each of multiple Service Station subsystems models a particular process abstractly using an Infinite Server block. Upon the completion of service, the job
% returns to the distribution center.

%setup
set_param([model_name,'/Scopes/Signal Scope1'],'OpenScopeAtSimStart','off');
set_param([model_name,'/Scopes/Signal Scope2'],'OpenScopeAtSimStart','off');
set_param([model_name,'/Scopes/Signal Scope3'],'OpenScopeAtSimStart','off');
set_param([model_name,'/Scopes/Signal Scope4'],'OpenScopeAtSimStart','off');
set_param([model_name,'/Scopes/Display Service History'],'OpenScopeAtSimStart','off');

%% Results and Displays
% The model includes these visual ways to understand its performance:
%
% *  A scope showing the service locations for jobs whose |JobID| attribute has
% a particular value.
sim(model_name);
scope_fig = [model_name,'/Scopes/Display Service History'];
des_scope2([],[],[],'ScopeUpdate',scope_fig ,'OpenFig');

%%
% *  Scopes showing the load at each service station. 
scope_fig1 = [model_name,'/Scopes/Signal Scope1'];
des_scope2([],[],[],'ScopeUpdate',scope_fig1 ,'OpenFig');
scope_fig2 = [model_name,'/Scopes/Signal Scope2'];
des_scope2([],[],[],'ScopeUpdate',scope_fig2 ,'OpenFig'); 
scope_fig3 = [model_name,'/Scopes/Signal Scope3'];
des_scope2([],[],[],'ScopeUpdate',scope_fig3 ,'OpenFig'); 
scope_fig4 = [model_name,'/Scopes/Signal Scope4'];
des_scope2([],[],[],'ScopeUpdate',scope_fig4 ,'OpenFig'); 

%% Experimenting with the Model
% You can set the particular value in the Display service history for jobs
% with ID parameter in the Distribution Center subsystem dialog box. Valid values are integers between 1 and 15.

clear(model_name);
des_scope2([],[],[],'ScopeUpdate',scope_fig1 ,'CloseFig');

des_scope2([],[],[],'ScopeUpdate',scope_fig4 ,'CloseFig');
