%% Introduction
% This demo shows the architectural modeling of an asynchronous 
% first in, first out (FIFO) buffer and uses the buffer 
% to enable processors with different clocks to manage data exchange. 

%% Overview of the FIFO Buffer Model
% A FIFO buffer is a hardware component that is used to store data as a 
% part of communications between  processors.  This demo shows the 
% structure of the model and how to use the model to regulate the flow
% of data between processors operating at different clock speeds. 
%
% The modeling of the buffer with a more functional implementation is shown in
% <matlab:simeventsdemohelp('sedemo_fifo_functional'); FIFO Buffer: Functional Model>.
%
% The model contains two processors and a FIFO Buffer that supports
% data transfer between the processors.  Processor A contains two tasks,
% the first tasks for communicating with Processor B and a background
% task. Processor B only contains a task for communication with Processor
% A.  The connections between the processors and the FIFO Buffer include
% signals for data transfer and signals for control of the data transfer. 

modelname = 'sedemo_fifo_architectural';
open_system(modelname);

%% Description of Processor A, Task 1
% Task 1 for Processor A increments its state, state A, with each trigger.  
% In addition, the processor includes logic to process the 
% *full* signal asserted by the FIFO Buffer.  This logic inverts the *full* 
% signal to assert the *wr_assert* signal to the FIFO Buffer. 
% The Integer Delay block represents the latency in the response of 
% Processor A to the *full* signal. 

open_system([modelname '/Processor A/Processor A Task 1']);

%% Description of Processor B
% Processor B accepts the state received from the FIFO Buffer via the Bin port 
% and stores it when triggered.  In addition, it includes logic to receive the
% *empty* signal from the FIFO Buffer and assert the *rd_assert* signal.

open_system([modelname '/Processor B/Processor B Task']);

%% Description of FIFO Buffer
% The FIFO Buffer subsystem includes the Event-Based Entity Generator and Set
% Attribute blocks to translate the *In* signal to an entity.  The entity is
% stored in the FIFO Queue block, released by the Release Gate block, and
% translated back to a signal by the Get Attribute block.  The *wr_clk* signal
% and *wr_en* signal combine to trigger the signal-to-entity translation while
% the *rd_clk* and *rd_en* signals combine to control the entity-to-signal
% translation.  The Compare to Thresholds subsystem contains logic that is
% triggered by control signals from the *rd_clk*, *rd_en*, and *wr_clk* inports
% of the FIFO Buffer subsystem 
% as well as the *#n* signal from the FIFO Queue block. This subsystem, in turn, 
% regulates the flow of entities to ensure that the buffer is not in an
% overflow or underflow state. The buffer capacity is specified on
% the FIFO Buffer mask dialog.

% Processor A writes until the instants that Processor B reads.

%% FIFO Buffer Model Behavior with Processor A Faster Than Processor B

% shows the FIFO Buffer block attempting to limit the number of storage 
% locations to the desired buffer capacity, 256.

%%
% The overflow is due to the latency in the response of Processor A to the 
% *full* signal from the FIFO Buffer.  The latency comprises propagation delay,
% CPU processing delay, and quantization effects.  The exact time at 
% which Processor A responds is quantized to synchronize with the clock
% for Processor A.

%% Description of the almost_full Signal to Manage Data Exchange
% The latency in Processor A's response to the *full* signal can be managed
% by using the *almost_full* signal from the FIFO Buffer.  The reduced
% threshold represented by the Almost Full Threshold block ensures that the
% overshoot does not result in exceeding the buffer capacity. 
%
% The use of the *almost_full* signal also allows for a more flexible use of the
% CPU in Processor A.  Since Processor A is capable of sending data faster
% than Processor B can accept, there is unused processing capacity in
% Processor A.  When the space used in the buffer reaches the *almost_full*
% threshold, Processor A can switch from the communication task to another,
% less critical task.  This task is represented by the Task 2 subsystem in
% Processor A.  

%% 

open_system([modelname '/Processor A']);

%% Description of Processor A, Task 2
% The Processor A Task 2 subsystem includes a Time-Based Entity
% Generator block that creates the enitity representing the second task in
% Processor A.  The task executes when the Enabled Gate 
% block allows the entity to advance.  
% The two Single Server blocks represent the time to switch
% context and to execute task 2.  When the entity is in the FIFO Queue
% block, the task is idle.  The *#n* signal disables the firing
% of the clock for Task 1 and the *wr_assert* signal, 
% effectively modeling the task switching in Processor A. 

close_system([modelname '/Processor A']);
open_system([modelname '/Processor A/Processor A Task 2']);

%% Behavior Using The almost_full Signal to Manage Data Transfer
% Running the model with the Almost Full Control block enabled shows that
% when the number in
% buffer rises slightly above the *almost_full* threshold, Processor A 
% switches context to task 2, and the number in buffer falls until 
% Processor A resumes task 1, the communications task.  
% The Almost Full Control block is located at the top level of the model.

%%
% The closeup shows the benefit of using the *almost_full* signal for
% ensuring the buffer's capacity is not exceeded. In addition, the plots 
% show that Processor A can execute
% lower priority, non-communication tasks while ensuring that data 
% is always available for Processor B.

% The values of state A and state B below show the uninterrupted 
% incrementing of the states until the first time the buffer is almost 
% full.  After this point the incrementing of State A is interrupted at 
% regular intervals, confirming the assertion of the *almost_full* signal and
% the change of task execution in Processor A.

% Processor B can be modified similarly to respond to the
% almost_empty signal to allow other, non-communication, tasks to be 
% executed while the buffer is almost empty.  This will help maximize
