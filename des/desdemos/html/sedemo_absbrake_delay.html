%% Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) Model with Queuing Delay

% Copyright 2008 The MathWorks, Inc.
% $Revision: 1.1.6.2 $ $Date: 2009/10/16 04:48:13 $

%% Overview
% This model is similar to the time-based
% <matlab:showdemo('sedemo_absbrake_nodelay'); Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS)
% Model,> except that simple queuing components introduce timing
% uncertainty into the braking system of this model. The queuing
% components, which are in the Delay subsystem, delay the update of signals
% from the controller to the Hydraulic Lag block.

modelname = 'sedemo_absbrake_delay';
open_system(modelname);

%% Behavior of the Delay Subsystem
% To see the implementation of the delay, open the Delay subsystem by
% double-clicking it.
%
% The subsystem attaches data from the controller to entities that move
% from block to block in the subsystem. If an entity reaches the Get
% Attribute block in the subsystem, the Hydraulic Lag block at the top
% level of the model can access the data attached to the entity. By the
% time the Hydraulic Lag block accesses the data, the data is delayed due
% to these cumulative effects:
%
% * Entities arriving at the Single Server block wait there for a random
%   amount of time.
%
% * If the Time-Based Entity Generator creates an entity while the server
% is busy and the queue is not full, the entity waits for an undetermined amount of time
%   in the FIFO Queue block.
%
% However, if the queue is full when the entity attempts to arrive, the
% Output Switch block discards the entity. As a result, the subsystem does
% not update the signal connected to the Hydraulic Lag block with this data
% value.
%
% The subsystem is similar to the one described in
% <matlab:helpview(fullfile(docroot,'toolbox','simevents','helptargets.map'),'adding_event_based_behavior'); Adding Event-Based Behavior>

open_system([modelname '/Network Delay'])

%% Experimenting with the Model
% (_For use with live model only_)
%
% You can vary the delay behavior by making one or more of these changes:
%
% * Scale the duration of the delay by changing the Gain parameter in the
%   Gain block next to the Delay subsystem. A value of 0 eliminates the
%   delay.
%
% * Vary the distribution of the service time by changing parameters in the
%   Random Delay block.
%
% * Vary the Delay subsystem's buffering capacity by changing the Capacity
%   parameter in the FIFO Queue block to zero or a positive integer. A larger
%   capacity increases the latency of successfully delayed data. However, a
%   larger capacity also reduces the number of data values that the system
%   drops when the server and queue are full.
