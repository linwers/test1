A six-step recipe models the main operations in sol production. Execution of these steps requires different resources. A batch reactor provides built-in capabilities to execute steps like adding color, adding particles and stir. Thus the resources required by these steps do not need to be modeled separately. The steps to add water, heat up and drain, on the other hand, require extra resources.

In this case, the production process in that batch reactor pauses until the water supply becomes available. In the Execute Chemical Process Recipe subsystem, such a resource sharing process is modeled by a FIFO Queue block labeled Wait for Water Supply and an N-Server block labeled Add Water in the Add Water subsystem, with the <b>Number of servers</b> parameter of the N-Server block modeling the capacity of the water supply. During simulation, the number of entities in the FIFO Queue block indicates the number of batch reactors waiting for water, and the number of entities in the N-Server block represents the number of batch reactors accessing water.</p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="sedemo_batch_production_03.png" alt=""> <p>The modeled batch production process is capable of producing two types of batches: type A and type B.

%
%% Results and Displays
%
% During simulation, the Data Analysis subsystem displays these scopes to
% demonstrate the performance of the production process:
%
% * Average number of orders in backlog 
% * Average number of batches waiting for water 
% * Average number of batches waiting for heat 
% * Average number of batches waiting for draining 
% * Utilization of batch reactors 
% * Utilization of water supply 
% * Utilization of heat supply 
% * Utilization of draining facility 
% * Throughput of type A batch 
% * Throughput of type B batch
%
% A Display block at the top level of the model also provides a numeric
% view of the utilization of all four types of shared resources.
%
%% Experimenting with the Model
% (_For use with live model only_)
%
% * To change the capacities of shared resources, double-click the
% configuration block in the colored region labeled Production System, and
% change the settings in the dialog.
% * To change the properties of either type of batch, double-click the
% corresponding configuration block in the colored region labeled Order
% System. Here you can change the period at which orders are generated for
% that type of batch by changing the *Order generation period* parameter,
% or change the recipe to produce such type of batch by changing other
% parameters. These parameters indicates the processing time a batch
% requires in a specific chemical processing step.
%
%% Using the Model to Analyze Production Process
% The model with the original configuration represents a production system
% equipped with inadequate resources. Such situation is common to
% manufacturing industry, where upgrade of existing production systems is a
% necessity with the growth of production demand.
%
% Simulation can help you find a solution to eliminate such inadequacies
% and improve the performance of the production system. The process of
% searching for solutions is the process of evaluating the existing
% production process and exploring alternative resource profiles.
% Simulation helps this process by effectively replicating what is
% happening or is going to happen in the real world.
%
% The following steps introduce how a performance improvement solution is
% developed for the modeled batch production process.
%
% *Step 1:* Run the simulation using the original resource profile. The
% scope labeled Average Volume of Order Backlog shows that orders
% accumulate. In addition, the scope labeled Utilization of Batch Reactors
% shows that the batch reactors operate at full capacity. Both quantities
% indicate that the system needs more batch reactors to enhance its
% production capability.
