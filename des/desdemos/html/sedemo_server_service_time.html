%% Server Blocks and Service Time

%% Overview
% This model illustrates features of blocks in the Servers library. 
% Distinct portions of the model vary the number of servers and the way to
% specify each entity's service time.

modelname = 'sedemo_server_service_time';
open_system(modelname);

%% Description
% The top portion of the model uses a Single Server block whose Service
% time parameter specifies a constant service time for all entities.
% 
% The middle portion of the model uses an Infinite Server block that has a 
% signal input port labeled t because the Service time from parameter is
% set to Signal port t. When an entity arrives at the server, the block
% uses the current value of the signal that connects to the t port as the
% service time for that entity.
% 
% The bottom portion of the model assigns an attribute called myServiceTime 
% to each entity. When an entity arrives at the N-Server block, the block 
% uses the value of the attribute as the service time for that entity. In 
% the block's dialog box, the Service time from parameter is set to 
% Attribute and the Attribute name parameter is set to myServiceTime.
% 
% Plots show the number of entities in each server. For the Single Server
% block, this number never exceeds 1. For the N-Server block, the number of
% entities in the server never exceeds N, which is 3 in this case. Plots
% also show the cumulative number of entities that have departed from each
% server.
