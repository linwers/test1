%% Processor Sharing Via Time Slicing

% Copyright 2008 The MathWorks, Inc.
% $Revision: 1.1.6.1 $ $Date: 2009/08/11 15:39:28 $

%% Overview
% This model illustrates how to model a shared processor that manages
% multiple tasks by time slicing. The processor swaps among the tasks every
% 0.1 seconds. As the number of unfinished tasks increases, it takes a
% given task longer to reach completion because more tasks are sharing the
% processor.

%% Time Slicing Shared Processor
% The Time Slicing Shared Processor subsystem receives tasks and calculates
% their effective priority. The effective priority weighting favors shorter
% older tasks. Tasks wait in a queue until the block labeled CPU Task Delay
% is available.
% 
% In parallel, the block labeled Time Slice Token Generator generates
% tokens periodically. The tokens, which have high priority, provide a
% mechanism for interrupting the service on a task so the CPU can switch to
% a different task. Upon arriving at the block labeled Priority Based
% Queue1, a token moves to the head of the queue, preempts a task in the
% block labeled CPU Task Delay, if any, and advances to the block labeled
% Time Slice Token Sink. No time passes between the generation and
% destruction of a time slice token.
% 
% A task preempted from the block labeled CPU Task Delay departs via the P
% port and joins the incoming tasks to undergo recalculation of effective
% priority, queuing, and completion of the next slice of service time.

%% Results and Displays
%
% The model plots these quantities to help you understand its performance:
%
% * Residual service time, that is, the remaining task execution time for
%   each task after preemption from the processor
%
% * Number of tasks waiting for service
%
% * ID of tasks in the processor, or â€“1 to indicate that a token arrives at
%   the processor
%
% * Utilization of the processor
%
% To experiment, try changing the value of the Avg Interarrival Time block
% before running the simulation.

sim(modelname);

%% Experimenting with the Model
%
% You can vary the simulation behavior by making one or more of these
% changes:
%
% * Change the average task length by changing the Mean parameter in the
%   block labeled Random Service Time.
%
% * Change the distribution of task lengths by changing the Distribution
%   parameter in the block labeled Random Service Time. Select another
%   distribution that yields only nonnegative samples.
%
% * Change the time-slicing interval by changing the Period parameter in
%   the block labeled Time Slice Token Generator in the Time Slicing Shared
%   Processor subsystem.
