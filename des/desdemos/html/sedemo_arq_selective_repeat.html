%% Selective-Repeat Automatic Repeat Request
%Copyright 2005-2008 The MathWorks, Inc.

%% Overview
% 
% This model simulates a selective-repeat automatic repeat request (ARQ)
% system. Packets are created, transmitted over a channel and affected by
% errors with a probability determined by the Forward Channel. This model
% allows you to visualize the system's behavior and analyze its performance
% under different conditions.

%% Structure of the Model
% 
model_name = 'sedemo_arq_selective_repeat';
open_system(model_name);
%%
% The model simulates the following processes: 
%%
% * Generating frames 
%
% * Transmitting frames through the forward channel 
%
% * Introducing errors to frames
%
% * Receiving frames and returning messages through the return channel
%
% For each received frame, the receiver sends an
% acknowledgement (ACK) or nonacknowledgement (NAK) message back to the
% transmitter based on a cyclic redundancy code (CRC) check. The transmitter retransmits only the frames corresponding to
% NAK messages.

%%% Frame Creation
%
% This subsystem generates data frames with an exponential intergeneration
% time. Each frame has a unique sequence number that identifies it. (This
% demo uses the term “frame” in an abstract sense that is unrelated to
% frame-based signals in Simulink(R) software.)

%%% Transmitter
%
% The transmitter transmits frames and also retransmits corrupted frames
% based on ACK and NAK messages from the receiver. An entity whose ack
% attribute is 1 corresponds to an ACK message, while 0 corresponds to a
% NAK message. Logic inside a discrete event subsystem controls the
% retransmission of frames. Flow control is handled through the
% retransmission queue, which becomes full when the number of
% unacknowledged frames equals the model's *Sliding window size* parameter.

%%% Forward Channel and Reverse Channel
%
% The forward and reverse channels represent the propagation delay, assumed
% to be longer than the delay associated with transmission. That is, the
% transmitter finishes sending the complete frame before the receiver
% begins receiving it. Packets are potentially corrupted, but not dropped,
% during transmission. The reverse channel is assumed to be error-free.

%%% Addition of Errors
%
% This subsystem corrupts packets with a given probability. The model
% assumes that the receiver can detect an error via a CRC check but cannot
% correct the error.

%%% Receiver
%
% The receiver sends an ACK or NAK message back to the transmitter for each
% frame and either accepts or rejects the frame according to the CRC check.
% After rejecting a frame, the receiver buffers subsequent frames until it
% correctly receives the rejected frame. At that point, the receiver
% reconstructs the frame sequence using the sequence numbers. The logic for
% the reconstruction is in the Embedded MATLAB(TM) Function block in the
% Discrete Event Subsystem block in the Sort Frames subsystem.

%% Results and Displays
%
% Scopes show the time and sequence number of four types of frames:
%
% *    Transmitted frames
%
% *    Frames accepted by the receiver
%
% *    Frames rejected by the receiver
%
% *     Frames in the reconstructed sequence
%%
% An additional scope displays the result of the CRC check for each received frame,
% where a value of 0 indicates an error.
