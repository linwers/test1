%% Asynchronous Execution of a Stateflow(R) Chart
%Copyright 2008 The MathWorks, Inc.

%%
modelname1 = 'sedemo_async_stateflow';
modelname2 = 'sedemo_async_stateflow_ent';

%% Overview
%
% This demo shows two alternative methods to execute a Stateflow(R) chart
% asynchronously, where a Simulink(R) signal is used to decide execution
% times. In this example, the chart computes its own execution times during
% the simulation. The two approaches are:
%
% * Delaying function calls
% * Delaying entities
%
% When using these techniques in your own models, you can choose the
% technique that you find most natural.
% 
% The top-level model shows a Stateflow chart and a subsystem that executes 
% the chart after a certain amount of delay.

open_system(modelname1);
set_param(modelname1, 'SimulationCommand', 'update');

%%
% The Stateflow chart logic increments the variable 
% |delay_time| upon each firing, and the value of this variable is 
% used as the delay before the next execution of the chart. When the delay 
% interval exceeds 5, the |End| state becomes active indicating that the
% chart will not be executed any more.

open_system([modelname1, '/Chart']);

%%
% Refer to the 
% <matlab:helpview(fullfile(docroot,'toolbox','simevents','helptargets.map'),'guidelines_chart_des');
% documentation>
% for instructions on 
% how to configure a Stateflow chart for use with SimEvents(R).

%% Method 1: Delaying Function-Calls
%
% The figure below shows the contents of the |Delayed Execution| subsystem
% for the first approach. It shows the use of delayed function calls to 
% execute the Stateflow chart at times determined by the chart itself. The
% model is available
% <matlab:open_system('sedemo_async_stateflow') here>. 

open_system([modelname1, '/Asynchronous Execution']);

%%
% A Function-Call Generator block executes the chart at the start 
% of the simulation. Subsequently, the chart produces the output 
% (|delay_time|) that determines the next firing time.
%
% A Signal-Based Event to Function-Call Event block converts the
% signal update of the chart into a function call f1 which is delayed by 
% the value of the block's |t| signal. This 
% function call is used to execute the Stateflow chart, thus effectively 
% causing a delayed execution.

%% Method 2: Delaying Entities
%
% The figure below shows the contents of the |Delayed Execution| subsystem
% for the second approach. It shows the use of entities to execute the
% Stateflow chart. The model is available
% <matlab:open_system('sedemo_async_stateflow_ent') here>.

load_system(modelname2);
open_system([modelname2, '/Asynchronous Execution']);
set_param(modelname2, 'SimulationCommand', 'update');

%%
% At the start of simulation, the Time-Based Entity Generator block
% generates the first entity. This
% entity moves immediately to the Entity-Departure Event to Function-Call 
% Event block which fires a function call that executes the Stateflow chart 
% for the first time. The intergeneration period of this Time-Based Entity
% Generator block is Inf and hence it does not generate any more
% entities throughout the simulation.
%
% When |time > 0|, the chart provides the next execution delay on its 
% first output port. Each time the chart executes, its output signal line
% updates, and this update event causes the Event-Based Entity Generator
% block to create a new entity. Each such entity is delayed in the Single 
% Server for a time equal to the |delay_time| produced by the chart. 

%% Results
%
% A simulation of both models yields the following results.

sim(modelname1);
open_system([modelname1, '/Scope']);

%%
% The spots on the x-axis where the value changes are the instants when the
% Stateflow chart executes. The values on the y-axis are the delays between
% successive execution times as computed by the chart, i.e. the values of
% |delay_time|. When |delay_time| exceeds 5, the chart no longer gets 
% executed and instead maintains its state.
