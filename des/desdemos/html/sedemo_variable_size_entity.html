%% Buffering for Variable-Size Messages

% Copyright 2008 The MathWorks, Inc.
% $Revision: 1.1.6.2 $ $Date: 2009/11/13 04:15:48 $

%% Overview
% This model demonstrates how a buffer can store messages that occupy a
% variable amount of memory. Entities represent the messages and possess
% attributes called length. A FIFO Queue block represents the buffer.
% Although the queue block in this model has no limit on its capacity, the
% preceding Enabled Gate block, labeled Admit Message, restricts entry to
% the buffer as necessary. This block depends on numerical and logical
% computations in the Preview Buffer Read Length and Buffer Size Controller
% subsystems, which determine whether the buffer can accommodate a new
% message based on the lengths of the new message and of the messages in
% the buffer.
%
% This model demonstrates two alternative strategies, one that checks the
% length of a message before determining whether the buffer has enough
% space for it, and one that admits messages to the buffer first and reacts
% to the additional length afterward. Using the block labeled Enable
% Preview Buffer, you can configure the model to implement one strategy or
% the other. The results are similar, but not identical.

%% Structure
% *Reading the Length Before the Message Enters the Buffer*
%
% By default, the simulation uses an early reading of the message length
% when performing computations. The overall strategy is to check the length
% and the memory available in the buffer before permitting the message into
% the buffer. The simulation behaves as follows:
%
% * When a new message arrives at the Preview Buffer Read Length
%   subsystem, the subsystem stores the message temporarily and updates
%   the early signal to reflect the length of the message.
%   
% * The Buffer Size Controller subsystem adds the length to its
%   cumulative total.
%     
% * The update in the total causes the Control Space Usage subsystem to
%   check whether the buffer has any available memory. The computation
%   involves the previously computed total of the lengths of the messages
%   that have exited the buffer during the simulation (sub signal). 
%
% If the early total minus the sub total is less than a buffer size
%     threshold plus 1, then the block labeled Admit Message permits the
%     message to advance to the buffer. Otherwise, the message stays in
%     the Preview Buffer Read Length subsystem until an update in the sub
%     signal indicates that enough memory is available in the buffer.
%
% *Reading the Length After the Message Enters the Buffer*
%
% If you change the block labeled Enable Preview Buffer so it connects to 0
% instead of 1, then the simulation uses a late reading of the message
% length when performing computations. The overall strategy is to check for
% memory in the buffer after the message has entered, and use an
% above-threshold situation to restrict the next message. The simulation
% behaves as follows:
%
% * When a new message arrives at the Preview Buffer Read Length
%   subsystem, the subsystem either stores the message or forwards it
%   to the buffer, depending on whether the block labeled Admit Message
%   permits or forbids advancement. If the subsystem stores the
%   message, the message has an opportunity to advance after an update
%   in the sub signal indicates that enough memory is available in the
%   buffer.
%   
% * After the message advances to the buffer, the Preview Buffer Read
%   Length subsystem updates the late signal to reflect the length of
%   the message.
%     
% * The Buffer Size Controller subsystem adds the length to its
%   cumulative total of the late signal.
% 
% * The update in the late total causes the Control Space Usage
%   subsystem to check whether the late total minus the sub total is
%   less than a buffer size threshold. If so, the block labeled Admit
%   Message opens so that the next message can advance to the buffer.
%   Otherwise, the next message stays in the Preview Buffer Read Length
%   subsystem until or unless an update in the sub signal indicates
%   that enough memory is available in the buffer..

%% Results and Displays
% By default, the model includes these visual ways to understand its
% performance:
%
% 1) A scope showing the amount of buffer memory used in the
%    computation in the Control Space Usage subsystem.
%
% * If the preview buffer is enabled, the quantity in the scope
%       differs from the buffer memory actually in use because the
%       computation includes the length of a newly arrived message
%       before it advances to the buffer.
%              
% * If the preview buffer is disabled, the quantity in the
%       scope matches the buffer memory actually in use because the
%       computation includes only messages in the buffer. 
%
% 2) A scope showing the amount of buffer memory that messages actually
%    occupy. When the simulation uses the early reading technique, this
%    signal does not exceed the buffer size threshold. When the
%    simulation uses the late reading technique, this signal can exceed
%    the buffer size threshold; when this occurs, the block labeled
%    Admit Message forbids the next message to advance to the buffer
%    until the buffer usage decreases sufficiently.
%
% 3) A scope showing the number of messages in either the buffer or the
%    Preview Buffer Read Length subsystem, at any given time during the
%    simulation (noncumulative).
%
% 4) A scope showing the state of the block labeled Admit Message. When
%    the enable signal is 1, a message in the Preview Buffer Read Length
%    subsystem can advance to the buffer. When the enable signal is 0, the
%    message cannot advance.
